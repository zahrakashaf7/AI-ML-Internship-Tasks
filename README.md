# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

# Objective:
Explore and visualize the **Iris dataset** to understand feature relationships and data distribution using Python.

# Dataset Used:
[Iris Dataset (built-in in Seaborn)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)

# Key Results and Findings:
- Petal features clearly separate species visually and in classification.
- Setosa flowers are clearly separable using petal features.
- Feature distributions are fairly normal.
- Dataset is clean, balanced, and contains no missing values.
